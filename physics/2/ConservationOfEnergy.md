Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred.

Work done is the amount of energy transferred by a force (scalar quantity). i.e. the amount of energy transferred from one form of energy to another.

_&Delta;W = F&Delta;s&thinsp;cos&hairsp;&theta;_

For example, picking up a box requires work to increase its gravitational potential energy.

Work done's unit is joules (J), or N&thinsp;m. Its base units are: kg&thinsp;m&thinsp;<sup>2</sup>s&thinsp;<sup>-2</sup>.

Kinetic energy is the energy that is transferred by a body's motion.

It can be calculated using the following formula:

E<sub>k</sub> = &half;mvÂ²
