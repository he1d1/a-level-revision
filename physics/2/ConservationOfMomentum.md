Momentum is a vector that is the product of the mass and the velocity of an object. In a collision, the momentum of the
two colliding objects is always conserved, given that there are no external forces acting on the objects.

_p = mv_

Some collisions can happen in two dimensions. In this case, you can solve the collision by splitting the momentum into
the horizontal and vertical components.
