<h2 id="conservation-of-charge-energy-and-momentum">Conservation of charge, energy and momentum</h2>

In particle interactions, [energy](physics/2/ConservationOfEnergy.md) of
and [momentum](physics/2/ConservationOfMomentum.md) are always conserved, as well as the total charge of the system.
Additionally, the total baryon number and the total lepton number are conserved.

## Why high energies are required to investigate the structure of nucleons

de Broglie wavelength is the wavelength associated with a particle. It is given by the formula:

_&lambda; = <sup>h</sup>/<sub>p</sub> = <sup>h</sup>/<sub>mv</sub>_

Momentum and energy are related by the formula:

E<sub>k</sub> = <sup>p<sup>2</sup></sup>/<sub>2m</sub>

When investigating the structure of nucleons, the wavelength of the wave used to observe the structure of the nucleon
has to be smaller than the nucleon. Therefore, with a lower de Broglie wavelength, smaller nucleons can be observed. As
a consequence, the energy of the wave observing the structure of the nucleon has to be high.

# _&Delta;E = &Delta;mc<sup>2</sup>_

Energy can be turned into mass and vice versa, using the equation in the heading. When a collision happens, if there is
a lot of left over energy, it is possible for more particles to be created from this energy.

For example, if two high-energy protons collide, it is possible for a proton and antiproton to be created. This is
called pair production. The reason an antiproton is created is that 
[change and baryon number need to be preserved](#conservation-of-charge-energy-and-momentum).

It only happens when there is a photon with enough energy to create a proton and an antiproton, this can be calculated with the
equation in the heading.

Pair annihilation is the opposite of pair production. It happens when a particle and its antiparticle collide.
This releases energy into photons.
